##  Physical Network Considerations

The propagation delay occurs in the Network Interface layer. This is where light passes through fiber and electric current flows through Ethernet (and so on). Internet networks consist of a variety of mixed forms of physical point-to-point links terminated by various telecommunications and networking systems that then interface with each other at junctions called routers. The computational processing in the terminations usually, but not always, happens as part of an electrical process or a photoelectric process with little computed logicâ€”so, for example, fiber multiplexers operate optically based on wavelength of light, and Ethernet switches work electrically based on the sequence of bits in the header of the datagram. There may be some delay introduced, but at this stage the latency is largely affected by propagation delay more than any other form of delay.
